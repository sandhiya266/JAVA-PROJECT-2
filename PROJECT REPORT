Project Report: Grade Calculator

Project Overview The Grade Calculator project is a Java-based application that calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage achieved. The program takes input marks obtained in each subject and provides a comprehensive report to the user.

Project Objectives The primary objectives of this project are:

To design and implement a Java program that calculates the total marks and average percentage based on input marks.
To assign a grade based on the average percentage achieved.
To provide a user-friendly interface for inputting marks and displaying results.
Project Design and Implementation The project is implemented using Java programming language. The program uses a Scanner object to input the number of subjects and marks for each subject. It then calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage achieved. The results are displayed to the user using System.out.println statements.

Project Features The Grade Calculator program has the following features:

User input for number of subjects and marks for each subject.
Calculation of total marks and average percentage.
Assignment of grade based on average percentage achieved.
Display of results, including total marks, average percentage, and grade.
Project Testing and Debugging The program has been thoroughly tested with various input scenarios to ensure accurate results. Debugging was performed to handle potential errors and exceptions.

Project Conclusion The Grade Calculator project is a successful implementation of a Java-based application that calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage achieved. The program provides a user-friendly interface and accurate results, making it a useful tool for students and educators.

Recommendations for Future Improvements Future improvements to the project could include:

Adding more advanced features, such as weighted average calculations or grade point average (GPA) calculations.
Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Expanding the program to handle more complex grading systems or multiple semesters.
Project Timeline The project was completed within a timeframe of [insert timeframe].
